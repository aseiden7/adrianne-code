# ATR Spectroscopy Data Similarity Analysis Report - UPDATED

**Analysis Date:** October 7, 2025  
**Dataset:** all_ATR_data_wide.csv (UPDATED)  
**Total Samples:** 37 (reduced from 39)  
**Duplicate Groups Analyzed:** 11 (reduced from 12)  
**Pairwise Comparisons:** 11 (reduced from 14)  

## üéâ Changes Made

### ‚úÖ **Successfully Resolved:**
1. **ID 103, wk0, soil** - Removed duplicate entries (was 2 samples)
2. **ID 119, wk10, soil** - Removed 1 duplicate (reduced from 3 to 2 samples)  
3. **ID 28, wk0, soil** - Fixed crop type mismatch (both samples now correctly labeled as wheat)

### ‚ùå **Still Needs Investigation:**
- **ID 80, wk10, soil** - Wheat vs Soybean mismatch remains (r=0.274)

## Executive Summary

After corrections, the dataset quality profile has shifted. While we eliminated some duplicate files and fixed labeling errors, the remaining issues are more severe and require focused attention. The percentage of poor correlations increased to 45.5%, but this reflects the removal of easily-resolved duplicates, leaving the genuine quality control problems.

## Updated Statistics

- **Mean Correlation:** 0.703 (was 0.756)
- **Median Correlation:** 0.835  
- **Standard Deviation:** 0.290
- **Range:** 0.235 to 1.000
- **Mean RMSE:** 0.028

## üö® URGENT: High Priority Issues (5 remaining)

### 1. Root Sample Reproducibility Crisis
- **ID 62, wk0, root:** r = 0.241 ‚ùå
- **ID 94, wk10, root:** r = 0.235 ‚ùå

**Status:** CRITICAL - Extremely poor reproducibility  
**Action Required:** Complete protocol review for root sample preparation

### 2. Remaining Crop Type Mismatch  
- **ID 80, wk10, soil:** Wheat vs Soybean (r = 0.274) ‚ùå

**Status:** URGENT - Verify sample identity  
**Action Required:** Check if this is a labeling error or cross-contamination

### 3. Poor Soil Sample Reproducibility
- **ID 79, wk0, soil:** r = 0.745 ‚ùå
- **ID 94, wk10, soil:** r = 0.726 ‚ùå

**Status:** HIGH PRIORITY - Inconsistent measurements  
**Action Required:** Review sample handling and storage protocols

## Medium Priority Issues (3 remaining)

### Moderate Reproducibility
- **ID 62, wk0, soil:** r = 0.835 ‚ö†Ô∏è
- **ID 87, wk10, soil:** r = 0.871 ‚ö†Ô∏è  
- **ID 119, wk10, soil:** r = 0.852 ‚ö†Ô∏è

**Recommendation:** Monitor these for patterns and investigate if similar issues emerge.

## Low Priority Issues (3 remaining)

### Good Technical Replicates
- **ID 28, wk0, soil:** r = 0.984 ‚úÖ (Now properly labeled as wheat/wheat)
- **ID 50, wk0, soil:** r = 0.972 ‚úÖ

### Perfect Match (Possible Duplicate)
- **ID 72, wk0, soil:** r = 1.000, RMSE = 0.000 ‚úÖ

## Immediate Action Plan

### üî• **TODAY - Critical Issues**

1. **Root Sample Protocol Emergency Review**
   - **Target:** ID 62 and ID 94 root samples
   - **Action:** Re-examine all root preparation steps
   - **Check:** Sample homogenization, grinding procedures, moisture content
   - **Timeline:** Immediate

2. **Sample Identity Verification**
   - **Target:** ID 80 wheat vs soybean files
   - **Action:** Cross-reference with lab notebooks and original labels
   - **Check:** Possible cross-contamination during processing
   - **Timeline:** Today

### üìã **THIS WEEK - Quality Control**

3. **Soil Sample Reproducibility Investigation**
   - **Target:** ID 79 and ID 94 soil samples  
   - **Action:** Review storage conditions between 12/5/24 and 12/9/24 runs
   - **Check:** Sample drying, container sealing, temperature exposure
   - **Timeline:** Within 3 days

4. **Protocol Standardization**
   - **Action:** Document standardized procedures for root vs soil preparation
   - **Focus:** Address why root samples show systematically poor reproducibility
   - **Timeline:** End of week

## Quality Metrics Tracking

### Before vs After Corrections

| Metric | Before | After | Change |
|--------|--------|-------|---------|
| Total Samples | 39 | 37 | -2 |
| Duplicate Groups | 12 | 11 | -1 |
| Perfect Matches | 3 | 1 | -2 ‚úÖ |
| Poor Correlations | 5 (35.7%) | 5 (45.5%) | +9.8%* |
| Crop Mismatches | 2 | 1 | -1 ‚úÖ |

*_Percentage increased but reflects removal of easy fixes, concentrating on real problems_

## Root Cause Analysis

### Why Root Samples Fail
1. **Sample Heterogeneity:** Root tissue may be more variable than soil
2. **Moisture Sensitivity:** Roots may respond differently to drying procedures  
3. **Preparation Challenges:** Root grinding/homogenization may be inadequate
4. **Matrix Effects:** Root organic matter may interfere with ATR measurements

### Recommendations for Root Samples
1. **Increase homogenization time**
2. **Standardize moisture content** before analysis
3. **Consider** grinding to finer particle size
4. **Implement** triplicate measurements for root samples

## Files Updated

- **New Detailed Results:** `ATR/atr_similarity_analysis_results_updated.csv`
- **Updated Report:** `ATR/ATR_Similarity_Analysis_Report_Updated.md`
- **Original Files:** Preserved for comparison

## Next Steps

1. **Address critical root sample issues** (IDs 62, 94)
2. **Resolve ID 80 crop mismatch** 
3. **Implement improved QC protocols**
4. **Consider setting correlation thresholds** (e.g., r < 0.80 = rerun required)
5. **Regular monitoring** of future duplicate measurements
