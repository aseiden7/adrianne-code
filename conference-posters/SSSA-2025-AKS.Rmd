# Introduction

Root-derived carbon is a key input to soil organic matter (SOM) in both managed and natural ecosystems, yet the role of roots’ chemical composition in determining SOM persistence remains uncertain. Suberin---a hydrophobic, carbon-rich biopolymer found in root cell walls---has been hypothesized to enhance long-term soil carbon storage, but its contribution is debated in light of emerging OM-stability paradigms that emphasize microbial and mineral interactions over intrinsic biochemical recalcitrance. This study investigates how varying suberin content influences mineralization rates and chemical transformations of root-derived organic matter in soil. 

# Methods
Using ¹³C-labeled roots spanning a natural suberin gradient, we tracked decomposition in both intact pots and litterbag microcosms over 30--40 weeks.

Spectroscopic analyses (DRIFTS, 13C-CPMAS NMR) were performed on roots isolated from the intact pots.</figcaption>

# Results
Spectroscopic analyses indicate that suberin persists in root tissues for at least 10 weeks, but is not readily detectable in the surrounding soil, suggesting limited transfer during early decay. The portion of organic carbon attributed to microbial biomass grew over time as expected.

# Conclusion
By integrating ¹³C tracers with molecular characterizations, this work advances a mechanistic understanding of soil carbon cycling at the root–soil interface by quantifying the partitioning of root-derived carbon between incorporation into SOM and mineralization to CO₂. Linking root chemistry variation to SOM dynamics can inform plant breeding programs and trait-based ecosystem management efforts aimed at enhancing long-term soil carbon stability.
